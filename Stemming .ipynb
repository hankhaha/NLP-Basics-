    "In the last chapter, we learned the basics of preparing our text to build the model. We learned how to **remove punctuation, tokenize, and removed stop words** to provide a clean list of words to Python. In this chapter, we're going to learn how to take our cleaning one step further, to provide the model with better information for classifying the text. We'll the introduce the concepts of **stemming** and memetizing in this chapter. Let's start with stemming. So what is stemming? The formal definition of stemming is the process of reducing inflected or derived words to their word stem or root."
